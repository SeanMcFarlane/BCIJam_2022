# bci-essentials-python
This reposity contains python modules and scripts for the processing of EEG-based BCI. 
These modules are specifically designed to be equivalent whether run offline or online.

### bci-essentials-unity
The front end for this package can be found in [bci-essentials-unity](https://www.github.com/kirtonBCIlab/bci-essentials-unity)

## Getting Started

Using the terminal
1. clone from git
```
git clone https://github.com/kirtonBCIlab/bci-essentials-python.git
```

2. Create and activate a conda environment (RECOMENDED)
```
conda create -n bci-essentials
conda activate bci_essentials
```

3. navigate to the bci-essentials-python directory and activate virtual env if desired
```
cd <your-local-bci-essentials-python-directory>
```

4. install with pip
```
pip install .
```


### The following is only for Apple silicon tensorflow install

5. The bci-essentials-python package depends on tensorflow, which does not officially support Apple silicon (as of December 2022).  However, there is an Apple supported build called [tensorflow-macos ](https://developer.apple.com/metal/tensorflow-plugin/) that will work.  To install:

```
conda install -c apple tensorflow-deps
pip install numpy --upgrade
pip install tensorflow-macos
pip install tensorflow-metal
```

6. In setup.py, change the tensorflow dependency to tensorflow-macos

7. install with pip

```
pip install .
```


## Offline processing
Offline processing can be done by running the corresponding offline test script (ie. mi_offline_test.py, p300_offline_test.py, etc.)
Change the filename in the script to point to the data you want to process.
```
python examples/mi_offline_test.py
```

## Online processing
Online processing requires an EEG stream and a marker stream. These can both be simulated using eeg_lsl_sim.py and marker_lsl_sim.py.
Real EEG streams come from a headset connected over LSL. Real marker streams come from the application in the Unity frontend.
Once these streams are running, simply begin the backend processing script ( ie. mi_unity_backend.py, p300_unity_bakend.py, etc.)
It is recommended to save the EEG, marker, and response (created by the backend processing script) streams using 
[Lab Recorder](https://github.com/labstreaminglayer/App-LabRecorder) for later offline processing.
```
python examples/mi_unity_backend.py
```
